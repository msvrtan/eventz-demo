Task:

Our event pages are high traffic pages. On an event page, you'll see active and sold tickets. There's also a possibility to add a 'wanted listing'. People who are looking for a ticket, can add a wanted listing and select the amount of tickets they are looking for. On the event page, the count of wanted tickets is shown. For an example, see: XXX and  XYZ.

Just create a simple and working version of our event page, with a counter of 'wanted tickets'. Add a button which links to a form where you can add a new wanted listing and select the amount of tickets you are looking for. Keep in mind we have a lot of event pages and those are high traffic pages ;) Feel free to use any language/framework you want.
